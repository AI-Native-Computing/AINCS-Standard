# AI-Native Computing Standard (AINCS) - v0.1 Draft

## 1. Overview
AI-Native Computing defines a paradigm where artificial intelligence functions as a **persistent, embedded entity** within software architectures.  
Unlike traditional AI implementations that rely on **stateless API calls**, AI-Native systems treat intelligence as an **intrinsic part of the execution environment**, designed to operate as a **first-class citizen** within applications.  

## 2. Core Principles
- **AI as a First-Class Execution Entity** – AI must not operate as an isolated, request-driven service; it must function within the same **execution environment** as the rest of the system, subscribing to state changes and interacting through a unified input pathway.
- **Unified Input & State Model for Humans & AI** – AI and human users must share the same **event-driven state propagation** and **input mechanism**, ensuring seamless interaction and contextual continuity.

## 3. Execution Model
AI-Native Computing introduces a layered architecture where AI is embedded within **live execution flows** rather than isolated calls.  
- **XSLAP (Execution Layer):** AI operates persistently within applications, **subscribing to system-wide events** and executing commands through the **same input pathway as human users**.
- **XANAF (State & Memory Layer):** AI and human interactions are processed through a **single input and state model**, ensuring AI participation is indistinguishable from human-driven events.

## 4. Governance & Evolution
AINCS follows an **open governance model** to ensure its principles evolve through real-world implementation and community-driven contributions.  
See [Governance](./governance.md) for details on how AINCS evolves.
