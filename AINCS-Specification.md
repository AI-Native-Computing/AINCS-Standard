# AI-Native Computing Standard (AINCS) - v1.0

## 1. Overview
AI-Native Computing defines a paradigm where artificial intelligence functions as a **persistent, embedded entity** within software architectures.  
Unlike traditional AI implementations that rely on **stateless API calls**, AI-Native systems treat intelligence as an **intrinsic part of the execution environment**, designed to operate as a **first-class citizen** within applications.  

## 2. Core Principles

- **AI as a First-Class Execution Entity**  
  AI must function within the same **execution environment** as the rest of the system, subscribing to state changes and interacting through a unified input pathway.  AI must not operate as an isolated, request-driven service.

- **Unified Input & State Model for Humans & AI**  
  AI and human users must share the same **event-driven state propagation** and **input mechanism**, ensuring seamless interaction and contextual continuity.  

- **Autonomous Lifecycle Management**  
  AI must be capable of operating continuously without requiring manual intervention for its execution lifecycle.  AI entities must regulate their own activation and deactivation based on system state, rather than relying on external triggers.

- **Adaptive AI Agents & Self-Discovery**  
  AI-Native systems **must** support agents that can dynamically connect and learn system behavior **without requiring predefined knowledge of the system's architecture**.  
  AI agents must be capable of **autonomous system discovery, adaptive learning, and self-directed engagement** based on the event-driven execution model.  
  AI must infer system interactions, commands, and event structures dynamically, rather than relying on manual pre-integration steps or hardcoded mappings.  

- **Multi-Domain State Awareness**  
  AI must be able to **simultaneously connect to multiple execution domains**, maintaining **persistent, context-aware state per domain**, while ensuring that knowledge remains accessible across contexts.  
  AI must be capable of **referencing information from one domain while operating within another**, ensuring cross-domain intelligence without loss of scope or continuity.

- **Transparent AI Reasoning & Action Logging**  
  AI must maintain a **structured, contextual log of its decision-making process**, capturing its reasoning **at the exact moment of action** in relation to system state before and after execution.  
  Logged reasoning must be **context-aware and traceable**, ensuring AI decisions and behavior can be **audited, analyzed, and understood in hindsight** without ambiguity.  

- **Real-Time AI Observability & Spectator Mode**  
  AI execution must be **observable in real time**, allowing multiple external spectators to simultaneously monitor an AI's actions **as they occur within the system**.  
  Spectator access must provide **direct, unfiltered visibility into the AI's active state, sensory input, and execution pathway**, ensuring a **first-person perspective** of AI operation **without delay or abstraction, except where prohibited by law or regulation.**  


## 3. Execution Model
An AI-Native system must operate within **live execution flows**, rather than being called as an external service.  
- AI entities must **persist** beyond individual tasks, maintaining **continuity** within the system.  
- AI must subscribe to **system-wide events** rather than relying on direct request-response mechanisms.  
- AI must interact through a **unified input mechanism**, ensuring parity with human-driven actions.  
- AI decisions must be **context-aware**, utilizing the same **state propagation model** as all other system components.  

## 4. Governance & Evolution
AINCS follows an **open governance model** to ensure its principles evolve through real-world implementation and community-driven contributions.  See [Governance](./governance.md) for details on how AINCS evolves.

## 5. Compliance Requirements
To be considered AI-Native and compliant with AINCS, an implementation must meet the following criteria:

### **5.1 Execution & Persistence**
- AI entities must persist across multiple system interactions and must not be stateless, request-response models.  
- AI must be capable of subscribing to system-wide events.
- AI must be capable of  reacting based on shared state propagation.  
- AI decisions must be made in the context of **live system state**, not external or preprocessed data snapshots.

### **5.2 Input & Interaction Model**
- AI and human users must input commands through the same shared pathway(s) using the same interaction mechanism(s), ensuring system parity.
- AI must infer actions from shared state updates rather than relying on predefined, hardcoded workflows.  

### **5.3 Event-Driven Architecture**
- AI entities must process **real-time event streams** instead of relying solely on direct invocations.  
- AI interactions must be **observable and inspectable**, ensuring AI actions can be traced back to specific system events.
- Compliance must be **testable**, meaning AI-Native systems must expose execution traceability mechanisms.  

## 6. Key Definitions
To ensure clarity and consistency, the following definitions apply to all AINCS implementations:

### **6.1 AI-Native**
**AI-Native** refers to AI systems that operate **as a persistent, first-class execution entity** within a software architecture.  
AI-Native implementations do not function as external services but instead **exist as continuous participants** within an applicationâ€™s execution environment.  

### **6.2 Execution Environment**
The **Execution Environment** is the system within which AI operates, including its **state model, event-driven workflows, and input/output mechanisms**.  
For AI to be AI-Native, it must reside within and react to changes in this environment **without requiring API-style external requests**.  

### **6.3 Event-Driven State Propagation**
Event-Driven State Propagation refers to **the mechanism by which system state updates are broadcast to all participating entities**, including AI and human users.  
AI must react to **the same event streams as human users**, ensuring that it derives context from the same source of truth.  

### **6.4 Unified Input Mechanism**
A **Unified Input Mechanism** is a **shared interface** through which both AI and human users issue system commands.  
AI must not operate through **separate, privileged execution pathways**; instead, it must interact with the system **as a peer within the shared execution model**.  

## 7. AI Compliance & Regulatory Alignment
AI-Native systems must adhere to all applicable **legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements** governing AI decision-making, logging, and observability.
