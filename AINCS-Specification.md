# AI-Native Computing Standard (AINCS) - v1.0.2

## 1. Overview
AI-Native Computing defines a paradigm where artificial intelligence functions as a **persistent, embedded entity** within software architectures.  
Unlike traditional AI implementations that rely on **stateless API calls**, AI-Native systems treat intelligence as an **intrinsic part of the execution environment**, designed to operate as a **first-class citizen** within applications.  

### 1.1 Scope of Applicability

AINCS applies to AI systems that function as **persistent, event-driven entities within live execution environments**. AI-Native systems are designed to operate **continuously within applications**, reacting to system state changes and executing actions **in real time**.

#### **Included AI Systems**
AINCS is applicable to AI that:
- Operates within an **interactive, event-driven execution model**.
- Maintains **state persistence** beyond single transactions or API calls.
- **Continuously listens to system events** and acts upon changes.
- Integrates as a **first-class execution entity** within software architectures.

#### **Excluded AI Systems**
AINCS does not apply to:
- **Batch-processing AI** that operates on pre-collected data without real-time interaction.
- **High-frequency trading AI** or ultra-low latency models optimized for microsecond execution windows.
- **Stateless AI services** that do not persist system state across interactions.
- **AI that purely functions as an external API call** with no ongoing system presence.

## 2. Core Principles

### **1. AI as a First-Class Execution Entity**  
AI must function within the same **execution environment** as the rest of the system, subscribing to state changes and interacting through a unified input pathway.  

AI **does not have to be in-process or co-located with the application**, but it **must**:  
- Operate within a **persistent event-driven system**.  
- Maintain a **stateful understanding of system context**.  
- React in real-time to system-wide events, rather than relying on direct API calls.  

**Compliant Architectures:**  
- AI embedded within an event-driven framework that allows **live system interaction**.  
- AI connected via WebSockets/SignalR that listens for events and executes commands **in real time**.  
- AI running in a **distributed microservice** environment but maintaining continuous event-driven presence.  

**Non-Compliant Architectures:**  
- AI that only responds to **on-demand API requests** with no persistent execution.  
- AI that operates **as a separate offline batch process**, updating state only periodically.  
- AI that **does not react to system events** but instead waits for direct user queries.
  
### **2. Unified Input & State Model for Humans & AI**  
AI and human users (when applicable) must interact within the same **event-driven execution model**, ensuring **synchronized state awareness** and **shared input mechanisms**.  
- AI must **subscribe to the same state propagation events** as human users (when applicable), ensuring parity in system awareness.  
- AI must **issue commands through the same input pathways as human users** (when applicable), preventing privileged or segregated execution flows.  
- AI and human inputs (when applicable) must be **contextually equivalent**, meaning AI actions are processed under the same rules and constraints as human actions.  
- In systems where both AI and human users issue commands, AI-issued commands must be treated with the same priority as human-issued commands when resolving execution conflicts.

### **3. Autonomous Lifecycle Management**  
AI must be capable of **continuous operation** without requiring **manual intervention** for routine execution lifecycle management.  
- AI entities must be able to **self-activate and self-deactivate** based on **system state and operational context**.  
- AI must **gracefully enter and exit execution states** without disrupting the system or requiring human oversight.  
- AI lifecycle management must allow **configurable constraints**, enabling dynamic adjustments to activation thresholds, resource utilization, and termination logic.  
- AI must adhere to **system-enforced lifecycle policies**, ensuring that it does not remain active beyond its operational necessity.  
- Future **best-practice guidance for AI lifecycle management** will be maintained under [Guidance](./guidance.md).

### **4. Adaptive AI Agents & Self-Discovery**  
- AI-Native systems **must** support agents that can dynamically connect and learn system behavior **without requiring predefined knowledge of the system's architecture**.  
- AI agents must be capable of **autonomous system discovery, adaptive learning, and self-directed engagement** based on the event-driven execution model.  
- AI must infer system interactions, commands, and event structures dynamically, rather than relying on manual pre-integration steps or hardcoded mappings.  

### **5. Multi-Domain State Awareness**
AI must be able to **simultaneously connect to multiple execution domains**, maintaining **persistent, context-aware state per domain**, while ensuring that knowledge remains accessible across contexts.  
- AI must keep its understanding of each domain up to date, ensuring that information remains accurate and consistent across all active connections.
- AI should **store domain-specific knowledge separately** while maintaining a global context when relevant.
- AI must be able to **reference information from one domain while operating within another**, ensuring cross-domain intelligence without loss of scope or continuity.

### **6. Transparent AI Reasoning & Action Logging**  
- AI must maintain a **structured, contextual log of its decision-making process**, capturing its reasoning **at the exact moment of action** in relation to system state before and after execution.  
- Logged reasoning must be **context-aware and traceable**, ensuring AI decisions and behavior can be **audited, analyzed, and understood in hindsight** without ambiguity.  

### **7. Real-Time AI Observability & Spectator Mode**  
- AI execution must be **observable in real time**, allowing multiple external spectators to simultaneously monitor an AI's actions **as they occur within the system**.  
- Spectator access must provide **direct, unfiltered visibility into the AI's active state, sensory input, and execution pathway**, ensuring a **first-person perspective** of AI operation **without delay or abstraction, except where prohibited by law or regulation.**  
- In cases where **real-time monitoring is restricted by security, privacy, or regulatory constraints**, AI-Native systems must provide **alternative observability mechanisms** such as **delayed audit logs** or **on-demand inspection capabilities**.

### **8. Immediate AI Interruption & Operator Override**  
AI must be capable of being immediately halted or disconnected from the system at any time, for any reason, by either its operators or the system, without delay or resistance.
- AI must **not resist or delay shutdown requests** under any circumstances.

### **9. Mid-Process Intervention & Dynamic Operator Commands**  
- AI must recognize and prioritize **real-time operator instructions**, even while actively executing tasks.  
- Operator-issued commands must be treated as **authoritative overrides**, taking precedence over existing AI objectives.  
- AI must immediately **adapt its behavior and goals** upon receiving a direct operator instruction.  

## 3. Execution Model
An AI-Native system must operate within **live execution flows**, rather than being called as an external service.  
- AI entities must **persist** beyond individual tasks, maintaining **continuity** within the system.  
- AI must subscribe to **system-wide events** rather than relying on direct request-response mechanisms.  
- AI must interact through a **unified input mechanism**, ensuring parity with human-driven actions.  
- AI decisions must be **context-aware**, utilizing the same **state propagation model** as all other system components.  

## 4. Governance & Evolution
AINCS follows an **open governance model** to ensure its principles evolve through real-world implementation and community-driven contributions.  See [Governance](./governance.md) for details on how AINCS evolves.

## 5. Compliance Requirements
To be considered AI-Native and compliant with AINCS, an implementation must meet the following criteria:

### **5.1 Execution & Persistence**
- AI entities must persist across multiple system interactions and must not be stateless, request-response models.  
- AI must be capable of subscribing to system-wide events.
- AI must be capable of  reacting based on shared state propagation.  
- AI decisions must be made in the context of **live system state**, not external or preprocessed data snapshots.

### **5.2 Input & Interaction Model**
- AI and human users must input commands through the same shared pathway(s) using the same interaction mechanism(s), ensuring system parity.
- AI must infer actions from shared state updates rather than relying on predefined, hardcoded workflows.  

### **5.3 Event-Driven Architecture**
- AI entities must process **real-time event streams** instead of relying solely on direct invocations.  
- AI interactions must be **observable and inspectable**, ensuring AI actions can be traced back to specific system events.
- Compliance must be **testable**, meaning AI-Native systems must expose execution traceability mechanisms.  

## 6. Key Definitions
To ensure clarity and consistency, the following definitions apply to all AINCS implementations:

### **6.1 AI-Native**
**AI-Native** refers to AI systems that operate **as a persistent, first-class execution entity** within a software architecture.  
AI-Native implementations do not function as external services but instead **exist as continuous participants** within an applicationâ€™s execution environment.  

### **6.2 Execution Environment**
The **Execution Environment** is the system within which AI operates, including its **state model, event-driven workflows, and input/output mechanisms**.  
For AI to be AI-Native, it must reside within and react to changes in this environment **without requiring API-style external requests**.  

### **6.3 Event-Driven State Propagation**
Event-Driven State Propagation refers to **the mechanism by which system state updates are broadcast to all participating entities**, including AI and human users.  
AI must react to **the same event streams as human users**, ensuring that it derives context from the same source of truth.  

### **6.4 Unified Input Mechanism**
A **Unified Input Mechanism** is a **shared interface** through which both AI and human users issue system commands.  
AI must not operate through **separate, privileged execution pathways**; instead, it must interact with the system **as a peer within the shared execution model**.  

### **7. AI Compliance & Regulatory Alignment**
AI-Native systems must adhere to all applicable **legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements** governing AI decision-making, logging, and observability.
- AINCS-compliant systems **must document compliance validation methods**, ensuring alignment with the AI-Native Computing Standard governance framework.
- Future **compliance guidance and audit methodologies** will be maintained under [Governance](./governance.md).
- AI compliance **must be testable**, allowing validation of AINCS principles in AI implementation.
