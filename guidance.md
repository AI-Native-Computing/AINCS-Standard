# AI-Native Computing Standard (AINCS) - Implementation Guidance  
**Version: 1.0**  
_Last Updated: March 2025_  

## 1. Introduction  
This document provides **best practices** for implementing AI-Native systems in compliance with AINCS. It covers **lifecycle management, resource optimization, and compliance validation**.  

## 2. AI Lifecycle Models
AI-Native systems should follow one of the following **lifecycle models**:  
- **Always Active** â€“ AI runs continuously for real-time interaction.  
- **Event-Driven Activation** â€“ AI activates on system events, conserving resources. *(Recommended Default)*  
- **Scheduled Execution** â€“ AI runs at defined intervals for periodic tasks.  

### Best Practices:  
- AI should **self-activate and deactivate** based on system state.  
- Implement **resource-aware behavior** to avoid unnecessary CPU/memory usage.  
- AI must always **exit gracefully** when no longer needed.  
- AI should **autonomously determine when to reconnect** based on system availability, recent state changes, and operational necessity.  

## 3. Compliance Validation  
To ensure AINCS compliance, use a **three-layer testing approach**:  
- **Self-Attestation** â€“ Verify against an internal compliance checklist.  
- **Observability Testing** â€“ Validate AI event logging & transparency.  
- **Execution Traceability** â€“ Ensure AI actions can be audited in real-time or retrospectively.  

ðŸ‘‰ Future compliance frameworks will be maintained under [Governance](./governance.md).
